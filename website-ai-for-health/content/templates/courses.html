    <h1> AI for Health course </h1>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare, offering healthcare professionals great opportunities to improve the care they provide. Radboud AI for Health, in collaboration with Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (<a href="https://www.jads.nl/">JADS</a>), offers the AI for Health course for clinicians, researchers and support staff working in hospitals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>For whom is this course?</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone believing there is more potential in healthcare data than is currently made use of</li>
      <li>Anyone wanting to support decision making processes through the use of healthcare data</li>
      <li>Anyone interested in getting an overview of the different possibilities and limitations of using AI to improve healthcare  </li>
    </ul>
    Successful AI projects draw upon clinical expertise, data expertise as well as programming expertise. This makes the AI for Health course just as relevant to clinicians as to professionals with a strong background in programming, statistics and/or data analytics.
