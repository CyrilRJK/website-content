    <h1> AI for Health course </h1>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare, offering healthcare professionals great opportunities to improve the care they provide. Radboud AI for Health, in collaboration with Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (<a href="https://www.jads.nl/">JADS</a>), offers the AI for Health course for clinicians, researchers and support staff working in hospitals. The next edition will start on <b>11-02-2022</b>. Apply before <b>17-12-2021</b> to join the course.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>For whom is this course?</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone believing there is more potential in healthcare data than is currently made use of.</li>
      <li>Anyone wanting to support decision making processes through the use of healthcare data.</li>
      <li>Anyone interested in getting an overview of the different possibilities and limitations of using AI to improve healthcare.  </li>
    </ul>
    Successful AI projects draw upon clinical expertise, data expertise as well as programming expertise. This makes the AI for Health course just as relevant to clinicians as to professionals with a strong background in programming, statistics and/or data analytics. To meet the needs of participants with different backgrounds as much as possible, the course offers <b>2 tracks</b>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Which track should I follow?</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Participants can choose to follow the 17 day <b>in-depth track</b>, where they will learn to implement AI themselves using Python.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, they can follow the 10 half-day <b>short track</b>, which provides a good overview of the role AI can have in clinical practice, without any programming involved.</li>
    </ul>
    Both tracks introduce the most important AI concepts such as machine learning and deep learning and all the necessary ingredients for a successful AI implementation, such as data understanding and preparation, and model evaluation. Different fields of AI applications are covered, such as medical image analysis, text mining and bioinformatics. The in-depth track provides participants also with practical exercises where they implement their own AI solutions. At the end of the course, participants will work in teams on their own AI project, where they get a feeling how to successfully create your own AI implementation.
