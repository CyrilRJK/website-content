## What you need to know for the third edition of the course:
- The next edition of the course will start 11-02-2022.
- There are 2 tracks to choose from: 
  - the in-depth track that requires programming and offers participants the ability to create their own AI solutions.
  - the short track that requires no programming and offers participants a good understanding of what AI is and how it can benefit your work.
- The course days consist of lectures in the morning and afternoon practicals with cases focused on Radboudumc practice.
- The program will mostly be held at Radboudumc in Nijmegen and a few times at JADS in Den Bosch.
- The course includes project days in the Radboudumc where you will work in a team on a Radboudumc project.
- We expect participants to spend on average 2-3 hours per week on homework and self study.
- There will be an online training environment with support documentation, discussion forum and blended learning.
- The course will end with a graduation ceremony where teams will present their project results and a certificate will be awarded.
