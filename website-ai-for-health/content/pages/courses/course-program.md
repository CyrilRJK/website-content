<li>The next edition of the course will start 11-02-2022.</li>
<li>There are 2 tracks to choose from: </li>
<ul>
  <li> An in-depth track that requires programming and offers participants the ability to create their own AI solutions.</li>
  <li> A short track that requires no programming and offers participants a good understanding of what AI is and how it can benefit your work.</li>
</ul>
<li>The course days consist of lectures in the morning and afternoon practicals with cases focused on Radboudumc practice.</li>
<li>The program will mostly be held at Radboudumc in Nijmegen and a few times at JADS in Den Bosch.</li>
<li>The course includes project days in the Radboudumc where you will work in a team on a Radboudumc project.</li>
<li>We expect participants to spend on average 2-3 hours per week on homework and self study.</li>
<li>There will be an online training environment with support documentation, discussion forum and blended learning.</li>
<li>The course will end with a graduation ceremony where teams will present their project results and a certificate will be awarded.</li>
