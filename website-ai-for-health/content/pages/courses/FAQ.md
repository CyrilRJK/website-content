##Do I have to bring my own project?

We encourage participants to bring their own project, but this is not mandatory. During the first weeks of the course, we select a few projects such that you can work on a project together with four other participants. Group projects are mentored by AI experts.

##I have an idea for a project, does it suit the course?

We welcome any ideas you might have regarding potential projects. You can pitch your ideas with the experts responsible for selecting the projects. If your project is selected, you will be the project leader for this project during the course.  

##What are the costs?

The course is free if you are working for RadboudUMC. For external participants, the cost of participation is €7500.-

##I don’t have any programming experience, is that a problem?

This is not a problem. If you want to develop your programming skills, you can make use of the subscription we provide to RealPython.com. If you do not have the ambition to learn how to program, but rather want to focus on understanding the principles behind machine learning, deep learning, etc, or develop yourself to being a linking pin between clinicians and data scientists, then this course is just as relevant to you.
