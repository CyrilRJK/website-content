description: Develop a method to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in breast cancer histopathology from a panel of immunohistochemical markers

**This is an AI for Health MSc project. Students are
elgible to receive a monthly reimbursement of â‚¬500,- for
a period of six months. For more information please read the
[requirements](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/requirements/).** 

## Clinical Problem 
Invasive breast cancer is increasingly treated with neoadjuvant (i.e., pre-operative) chemotherapy. However, it is effective only for some patients.

## Solution 
Develop biomarkers based on the joint analysis of multiple digital pathology whole-slide images of pre-operative breast cancer biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and a panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers to predict treatment response.
