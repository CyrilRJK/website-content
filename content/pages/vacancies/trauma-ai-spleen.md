description: Develop a method to automatically find statements in radiology reports on presence, size and type of lesions in CT scans. 

 

## Clinical Problem 

Segment spleen, detect trauma lesions, proediction clinical event (rebleeding)
 

## Solution 

app on grand-challenge.org

 

## Data 

Castor database 150 positive, 500 negatives

 

## Embedding 

Students will be supervised by two PhD students from the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) with experience in NLP and image processing using deep learning approaches. We provide access to a [large GPU computation cluster](https://rtc.diagnijmegen.nl/software/sol/).  

The final deliverable is a code repository on GitHub, a publicly available algorithm on the platform [Grand Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org), a report and validation study and preferably a scientific publication. 

 

## Requirements 

- Students with a major in data science, computer science, or artificial intelligence in the final stage of master level studies are invited to apply. 

- Interest in natural language processing and machine learning. Affinity with image processing is also welcome. 

- Affinity with programming in Python and with deep learning packages is required. 

 

## Information 

- Project duration: 6 months 

- Location: Radboud University Medical Center
