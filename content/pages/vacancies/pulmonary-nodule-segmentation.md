description: Develop a method to automatically segment subsolid pulmonary nodules using deep learning

**This is an AI for Health MSc project. Students are
elgible to receive a monthly reimbursement of â‚¬500,- for
a period of six months. For more information please read the
[requirements](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/requirements/).** 

## Clinical Problem 
Brief Description of the project
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for nearly 25% of all
cancer deaths. While lung cancer typically shows up as pulmonary nodules on CT images, most nodules are benign
and do not require further clinical workup. However, radiologist workload is expected to drastically increase soon
with the widespread implementation of lung cancer screening programs. Therefore, accurate detection and
characterization of pulmonary nodules is crucial for optimizing screening.

Among the different kinds of nodules, subsolid pulmonary nodules are routinely encountered in screening and carry
a higher malignancy risk. Clinical reporting guidelines recommend different management strategies based on the
radiological appearance and biological behaviour of nodules. For subsolid nodules, the management decisions are
dependent on accurate volumetric measurements and tracking the evolution of the solid core.

## Solution 
The Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG) at Radboud University Medical Center has brought Veolity, a dedicated
software solution for efficient reading of chest CT scans in lung cancer screening programs, to the market with MeVis
Medical Solutions (Bremen, Germany). This product is actively being used by several sites in North America, Europe,
Asia and Australia. The software includes computer-aided detection and traditional image processing algorithms for
volumetric measurements of both solid and subsolid nodules. The aim of the project will be to build on top of this
work and develop an algorithm for automatic segmentation of the full nodule, the solid core, and the vessels in
subsolid nodules using deep learning.

## Data 
DIAG has a scientific archive of over 100,000 chest CT scans. The archive also has voxel-level labels for more than
20,000 screen-detected nodules which may be utilized for development of nodule segmentation algorithms. The
algorithm(s) that come out of this project will be made publicly available for research use as Docker containers
through the grand-challenge.org platform. Significant findings will result in a publication as well.
