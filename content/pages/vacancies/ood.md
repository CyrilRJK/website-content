description: Develop a method for out-of-distribution detection to make AI more reliable and robust

**This is an AI for Health MSc project. Students are
eligible to receive a monthly reimbursement of â‚¬500,- for
a period of six months. For more information please read the
[requirements](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/requirements/).** 

## Clinical problem

## Solution 

## Data 
We have different sets of data available from previous projects in the analysis of x-rays, ultrasound images and color fundus images. In all cases out-of-distribution datasets can be defined as well. We collaborate in this project with Delft Imaging, a company that develops various AI products for radiology.
