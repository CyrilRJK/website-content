Peter Koopmans is an assistant professor at the Radiation Oncology department and the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group. He is an MR physicist specialized in accelerated imaging and image contrast manipulation. His work is focused on acceleration of the workflow on the MR-Linac, a device for image-guided radiotherapy. Objectives include, fast A.I.-driven contouring of tumors and organs, A.I. driven updating of the radiation treatment plan, and manipulating the MR acquisition to both improve tumor visibility as well as temporal resolution, to benefit the treatment of tumors in regions prone to motion (e.g. abdomen). 

Peter studied Applied Physics (biomedical engineering) at the University of Groningen, with scientific projects on otoacoustic emissions, MRI-based volumetric analysis of brain structures in Huntington’s disease, and design and construction of an fMRI signal generation phantom to investigate temporal stability of fMRI. He then obtained his PhD in MR Physics at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging on the topic of fMRI of cortical layers. On a Sir Henry Wellcome Trust postdoctoral fellowship he worked at the FMRIB Centre in Oxford, UK on high-resolution diffusion MRI and parallel transmission at 7T, followed by a 5-year Emmy Nöther fellowship grant of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft to work on layer-specific fMRI of pain perception as a PI at the Erwin L. Hahn institute for Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Essen, Germany.
