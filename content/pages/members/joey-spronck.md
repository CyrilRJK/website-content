Hans Pinckaers is a PhD candidate in the  [Computational Pathology group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) of the [Department of Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/departments/pathology) of the  [Radboud University Medical Center](https://www.radboudumc.nl/research) in Nijmegen. He studied Medicine at [Leiden University Medical Center](https://lumc.nl) for which he obtained his MD in 2016. After his graduation he worked one year as a Pathology resident. In 2017, Hans joined the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) where he works under the supervision of [member/geert-litjens] and [member/jeroen-van-der-laak] on deep learning for improved prognostics in prostate cancer ([project/deeppca] project).

Joey studied [Cancer, Stem Cell and Developmental Biology](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/cancer-stem-cells-and-developmental-biology) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en), where he mainly focused on tumor biology, bioinformatics, and applied data science. This eventually sparked his interest in deep learning and AI, which lead him to study [Information Studies: Data Science](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), for which he obtained his second master’s degree (cum laude). For his master thesis, Joey joined the [DIAG](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) chest CT group under supervision of [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/) where he worked on synthetic data augmentation of lung nodule CT images, using several Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). After obtaining both master’s degrees, Joey started as a PhD student in the Computational Pathology group under supervision of [member/francesco-ciompi] in 2021. In his project, he combines his interest in tumor biology and AI to improve the prediction of immunotherapy response in lung cancer.
