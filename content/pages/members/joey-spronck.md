Joey studied [Cancer, Stem Cell and Developmental Biology](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/cancer-stem-cells-and-developmental-biology) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en), where he mainly focused on tumor biology, bioinformatics, and applied data science. This eventually sparked his interest in deep learning and AI, which lead him to study [Information Studies: Data Science](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), for which he obtained his second master’s degree (cum laude). For his master thesis, Joey joined the [DIAG](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) chest CT group under supervision of [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/) where he worked on synthetic data augmentation of lung nodule CT images, using several Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). After obtaining both master’s degrees, Joey started as a PhD student in the Computational Pathology group under supervision of [member/francesco-ciompi] in 2021. In his project, he combines his interest in tumor biology and AI to improve the prediction of immunotherapy response in lung cancer.
