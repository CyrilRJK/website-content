Kiran is a PhD candidate at Radboudumc. He started working at the  in November 2019. His research interests revolve around the development of deep learning algorithms for early lung cancer detection from chest CT images. He is supervised by [member/bram-van-ginneken], [Mathias Prokop](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/people/mathias-prokop) and [member/colin-jacobs] under [project/lung-cancer-screening] at DIAG.

Kiran obtained his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in the Engineering Design department at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), in 2016, with a specialization in Biomedical Design. He worked on brain tumor segmentation using deep learning for his Master's thesis at the [MiRL](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~gankrish/) lab. After his graduation, he worked at [Predible Health](http://prediblehealth.com/) for three years and developed deep learning solutions for medical image analysis.

Noa Antonissen is currently a PhD candidate in the[Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) at the Medical Imaging Department of Radboudumc.
She obtained her Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Medicine at the Radboud University in 2021. During her studies she worked as a medical student at the Medical Imaging department and was involved in multiple AI-driven detection projects.

In May 2022 she joined DIAG as a PhD candidate to work on the NELSON POP project: multi-source data approach for personalized outcome prediction in lung cancer screening. This project focuses on improving the efficiency of lung cancer screening by using AI algorithms. She will be supervised by [member/colin-jacob], Cornelia Schaefer-Prokop and Mathias Prokop.

After obtaining her PhD degree, she is planning to continue her career as a radiology resident at Radboudumc.
