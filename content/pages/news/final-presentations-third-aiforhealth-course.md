Friday, Juli 1st, 2022, the third AI for Health course concluded with a meeting where all participants presented their AI projects' results. About 25 Radboudumc employees and external health professionals from different backgrounds followed the third course. The fourth edition is scheduled to commence in February 2023, and if you are interested, you can send an e-mail to aiforhealth@radboudumc.nl.

Radboudumc organizes the 16-day course together with the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science ([JADS](https://www.jads.nl/)) in Den Bosch. As part of the course, teams of participants perform an AI project. The presentations of these projects demonstrated the diversity of AI applications in healthcare. 

Erik Hazenberg, Floor Wilting, Niklas Bruse and Dominique van Midden worked on the **Detection of bacteria growth using deep learning**. Inspecting petri dishes for bacterial growth is very time consuming due to the high amount of dishes that are produced daily. Making this daily inspection of up to 5000 petri dishes more efficient could lead to great savings in time and resources. Using deep learning, the team created a very reliable algorithm that could detect growth versus no growth on the petri dishes, thereby helping lab analysts to focus on the petri dishes that have shown growth. Further development of the algorithm should lead to better quantification of the amount of growth and the type of bacteria detected.

Sanne Vermorgen, Megan Schuurmans, Evelien van Genugten, Pui-Yuen Li and Leslie Tessier worked on **Lymph node screening using deep learning**. Lymphoma's are rare types of abnormalities that can be found on regular inspections of lymph nodes by a pathologist. Because of it's rarity it is hard to detect for pathologist that are not specialized in hematologic pathology. The team developed an AI algorithm to distinguish between lymphoma and reactive lymph nodes. While showing promising results, further development is necessary to make it suitable for clinical use.
